# Predicting-Credit-Card-Fraudulent-Transactions-Using-Synthetic-Data-Generation
### In this project, the objective was to predict fraudulent transactions using a credit card. Data was highly imbalanced, so we worked with sampling techniques and some methods like undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE etc. we choose synthetic data generation method because it gave better results than others.
